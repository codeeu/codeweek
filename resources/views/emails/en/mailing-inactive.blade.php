Dear EU Code Week enthusiast <br/><br/>

EU Code Week starts tomorrow for two weeks of Coding fun!
You have been active in the last years, but we noticed that you have not registered any activities on the map this year.

Have you planned an activity for Code Week this year?
Please <a href="https://codeweek.eu/add">add them into our map</a> this year again!
Having more activities on the map helps put the spotlight on the importance of encouraging young people to learn important coding, computing and digital skills.

No idea for new activities this year?
Do not hesitate to take a look at <a href="https://codeweek.eu/2021/challenges">our EU Code Week Challenges</a> designed by pedagogical experts in our team, industry partners and Code Week Ambassadors, and adapt them for your group or classroom!

Thank you and letâ€™s together make the world a little more fun through Coding!

Happy EU Code Week!

Best,<br/>
The Code Week Team<br/><br/>
