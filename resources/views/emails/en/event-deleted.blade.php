Unfortunately, the EU Code Week ambassadors in your country were not able to approve your submission.

The activity was not Code Week related, it was contrary to the Code Week objectives and goals.

If you feel that this decision was made in error, please feel free to make a new application and provide more details about what you will do and how your activity relates to coding and computational thinking.

If you have any other questions, do not hesitate to contact the Ambassador in your country.

<p>In the meantime, are you interested in learning more about coding or looking for some inspiration for preparing
your #CodeWeek activity?</p>
