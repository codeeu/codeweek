           <h4 id="#header-3"><strong>3. On what legal ground(s) do we process your personal data?</strong></h4>
            <p>We process your personal data on several grounds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Article 6(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) (2016/679)</strong>, for the operation and administration of
                    the website, the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the Legitimate
                    Interest of the Code 4 Europe Consortium. We ensure that adequate and specific safeguards are
                    implemented for the processing of personal data, in line with the applicable data protection
                    legislation. </li>

                    freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.</li>
