            <p>This privacy statement explains the reason for the processing of your personal data, the way we collect,
                handle and ensure protection of all personal data provided, how that information is used and what rights
                you have in relation to your personal data. It also specifies the contact details of the responsible
                joint controllers with whom you may exercise your rights, the relevant Data Protection Officers, and the

            <h3 id="header-2"><strong>2. @lang('privacy-statement.2-why.title')</strong></h3>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose of the processing operation</span>: The
                joint-controllers employ an external infrastructure to host the website. The technical setup collects
                and uses your personal information to be able to provide for the website’s proper operation.</p>
            <p>The purposes of the processing are the following:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left:40px; margin-top:4px;">
                <li>To process personal data of visitors in order to operate and administer the EU Code Week website;
                </li>
                <li>To process data subjects’ e-mail addresses, passwords or social media authentication to grant them
                    access to their personal accounts on the website. This access allows them to authenticate
                    themselves, access and update their profiles and to access certificates and register activities;
                </li>
                <li>To process data subject’s email addresses and other information provided when they use the contact
                    form via the ”Getting in Touch“ button.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Personal data will not be used for an automated decision-making, including profiling.</p>

            <h3 id="header-3"><strong>3. On what legal ground(s) do we process your personal data?</strong></h3>
            <p>We process your personal data on several grounds:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left:40px; margin-top:4px;">
                <li><strong>Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</strong>: for the operation and administration
                    of the website, the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
                    interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Union institution or body. Indeed,
                    informing the broad public is a task resulting from the European Commission's own prerogatives at
                    institutional level, as provided for in Article 58(2) (d) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of
                    the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the
                    general budget of the Union (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1) and <strong>Article 6(1)(f) of Regulation
                        (EU) 2016/679</strong>: the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
                    pursued by the joint controllers or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by
                    the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of
                    personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Article 5(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Article 6(1)(a) of Regulation (EU)
                        (2016/679)</strong>: for the processing activities consisting in cookies, authentication and
                    getting in touch with us, consent is necessary. In compliance with Article 3(15) of Regulation (EU)
                    2018/1725, Article 3(11) of Regulation (EU) (2016/679), Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and
                    Article 7 of Regulation (EU) (2016/679), consent must be freely given, specific, informed and
                    unambiguous.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where we rely on consent, we obtain it directly from the data subject, and it can be expressed by an
                email, submitted via e-registration form, or in any other electronic or written form.</p>

            <h3 id="header-4"><strong>4. Which personal data do we collect and further process?</strong></h3>
