                        <li>Collaborate with other national ambassadors from across Europe.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>In return, you will be able to:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meet a lot of smart, interesting people from a variety of industries.</li>
                        <li>Become an essential part of one of the greatest grassroots initiatives in Europe.</li>
                        <li>Help us raise awareness about the importance of coding and getting Europe truly digital.</li>
                        <li>Add the 'EU Code Week Ambassador' title to your already amazing CV.</li>
                        <li>Learn to code! (in case you don&rsquo;t yet already)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what it all means in a bit more detail:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One of our goals is to connect various coding and educational networks. <strong>If you know of any coding events taking place, let the organizers know about Code Week and help them add the event to the Code Week website</strong>, so we&rsquo;ll have a comprehensive list of all coding events in Europe.</li>
                        <li>We&rsquo;re also hoping to see more events organized for Code Week. You can help by <strong>encouraging</strong> <strong>schools, organizations, developer communities, and enthusiastic individuals to start new, beginner friendly events in your country</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be during Code Week itself, although that will be the prime time for our promotional activities. To help you out, we&rsquo;re preparing a list of suggestions for companies, a <a href="https://codeweek.eu/guide">guide for potential event organizers</a>, and we&rsquo;re also building a variety of other <a href="https://codeweek.eu/toolkits">promotional resources</a>. </li>
                        <li>We need your help to <strong>respond to emails regarding Code Week in your country.</strong> You&rsquo;ll be the primary point of contact for anything that&rsquo;s going on in your country, so you can <strong>connect people and companies from your country that might benefit from getting connected with each other</strong> and provide answers in your language. Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t know all the answers yet, we&rsquo;re here to help.</li>
                        <li>Everyone can add their coding event to <a href="https://codeweek.eu/events">https://codeweek.eu/events</a>, but you&rsquo;ll be the moderator for events in your country. All you need to do is to regularly<strong> take a quick look at submitted events and check if they are a good fit for Code Week</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>It needs to be easy for everyone to start a coding event. You probably know some great online learning materials for beginner coders in your language, <strong>so you can maintain a list of resources for your country on the EU Code Week website</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide interesting news and content about coding from your country</strong> that we can promote on Code Week social media channels. We&rsquo;re primarily looking for content in English, so you can help by asking organizers to share their stories and tips in English for <a href="http://blog.codeweek.eu">our blog</a>. Additionally, you can also set up your national Code Week social media channels to promote content in your own language.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Together with your help, we&rsquo;ll be building a library of Code Week materials that can be used to promote coding as a skill. <strong>We need your help to spread the materials in your country and even encourage different groups to provide translations</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>We&rsquo;re creating a network of national ambassadors to promote Code Week and we&rsquo;ll also try to schedule monthly online calls to discuss our work, exchange good practices and inspire each other with ideas for further activities&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to attend all meetings, but we hope you can join us as often as possible. We also have a mailing list for EU Code Week Ambassadors that you can use any time to get advice or help from other ambassadors. <strong>You&rsquo;ll be able to expand your own network and get fresh ideas by collaborating with other ambassadors from across Europe.</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Still interested? We want you in on this! Take a quick look at the <a href="https://codeweek.eu/ambassadors">list of EU Code Week Ambassadors</a>. If there&rsquo;s one for your country, feel free to get in touch directly with them and see how you can cooperate. Either way, we&rsquo;ll be looking forward to you email at&nbsp; <a href='mailto:info@codeweek.eu?subject=EU Code Week Ambassador'/>info@codeweek.eu</a>.</p>
