            <h4 id="#header-1"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h4>
            <p>The Code4Europe is committed to protecting your personal data and to respecting your privacy. The Code4Europe
                collects and further processes personal data pursuant to <a
                    href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679&amp;qid=1716801254470">Regulation
                    (EU) 2016/679</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 27 April 2016, on the protection of
                natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and
                repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereafter, Regulation (EU) 2016/679).</p>
            <p>This privacy statement explains the reason for the processing of your personal data, the way we collect,
                handle and ensure protection of all personal data provided, how that information is used and what rights you
                have in relation to your personal data. It also specifies the contact details of the responsible joint
                controllers with whom you may exercise your rights, the Data Protection Officers and the relevant Data
                Protection Authorities.</p>
            <h4 id="#header-2"><strong>2. Why and how do we process your personal data?</strong></h4>The controller collects the personal
                data of activity organisers in order to be able to issue certificates, to publish the registered activities
                on the EU Code Week map (<a href="https://codeweek.eu/events">https://codeweek.eu/events</a>) and to conduct
                statistical analyses. </p>
            <p>The controller publishes the personal data of EU Code Week ambassadors and leading teachers in the community
                section of the EU Code Week website (<a
                    href="https://codeweek.eu/community">https://codeweek.eu/community</a>) to facilitate the identification
                of contact points by citizens, stakeholders as well as the joint controllers. Offering contacts with
                individuals rather than functional mailboxes is often the best and most efficient way to ensure that
                interested people can get in contact with the relevant EU Code Week contact points at national level. </p>
            <p>The controller processes the personal data of edu coordinators in order to get in touch with those contact
                points. </p>
            <p>Personal data will not be used for an automated decision-making, including profiling.</p>
            <h4 id="#header-3"><strong>3. On what legal ground(s) do we process your personal data?</strong></h4>The controller collects,

                an event on the <a href="https://codeweek.eu/register">EU Code Week</a> map. Edu coordinators provided their
                consent via email or filling in an EU Survey.</p>

            <h4 id="#header-5"><strong>5. How long do we keep your personal data?</strong></h4>

                further processing. All personal data will be deleted from database in December 2029 or until you withdraw
                from the EU Code Week initiative.</p>
            <h4 id="#header-6"><strong>6. How do we protect and safeguard your personal data?</strong></h4>All personal data in electronic
                format (e-mails, documents, databases, uploaded batches of data, etc.) are stored on the servers
                administered by the Commission. All processing operations are carried out pursuant to the <a
                    href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1548093747090&amp;uri=CELEX:32017D0046">Commission
                    Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/46</a>, of 10 January 2017, on the security of communication and information

                organisational measures. Technical measures include appropriate actions to address online security, risk of
                data loss, alteration of data or unauthorised access, taking into consideration the risk presented by the
                processing and the nature of the personal data being processed. Organisational measures include restricting
                access to the personal data solely to authorised persons with a legitimate need to know for the purposes of
                this processing operation.</p>
             <h4 id="#header-7"><strong>7. Who has access to your personal data and to whom is it disclosed?</strong></h4>

                provided their consent to transfer their contact details to Code4Europe will be deleted from the community
                page of the website.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of increasing the Code Week Ambassador and Leading Teacher’s or the registered activities’
                visibility and facilitating the identification of those contact points by citizens and stakeholders (e.g. to
                find out more about the initiative at local level, get help for the organisation of activity, etc.),
                personal data including the name, the email address, a picture, biography, the title and the field of
