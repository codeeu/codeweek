                    Coding is the language of things, which allows us to write programs to grant new functionalities to the tens of billions of programmable objects around us. Coding is the fastest way to make our ideas come true and the most effective way to develop computational thinking capabilities. However, technology is not strictly required to develop computational thinking. Rather, our computational thinking skills are essential to make technology work.

                    In this video, Alessandro Bogliolo, Professor of Computer Systems in Italy and Europe Code Week Coordinator, will introduce unplugged coding activities that can be practiced without any electronic device. The main purpose of unplugged activities is to lower the access barriers to bring coding in every school, regardless of funding and equipment.

                    Computational thinking (CT) describes a way of looking at problems and systems so that a computer can be used to help us solve or understand them. Computational thinking is not only essential to the development of computer programs, but can also be used to support problem solving across all disciplines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can teach CT to your students by getting them to break down complex problems into smaller ones, (decomposition), to recognize patterns (pattern recognition), to identify the relevant details for solving a problem (abstraction); or setting out the rules or instructions to follow in order to achieve a desired outcome (algorithm design). CT can be taught across different disciplines, for instance in Mathematics (figure out the rules for factoring 2nd-order polynomials), Literature (to break down the analysis of a poem into analysis of meter, rhyme, and structure), Languages (find patterns in the ending letters of a verb that affect its spelling as tense changes) and many others.

                    Visual programming lets humans describe processes using illustrations or graphics. We usually speak of visual programming as opposed to text-based programming. Visual programming languages (VPLs) are especially well adapted to introduce algorithmic thinking to children (and even adults). With VPLs, there is less to read and no syntax to implement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this video, Margo Tinawi, Web Development Teacher at Le Wagon and Co-Founder of Techies Lab asbl (Belgium), will help you discover Scratch, one of the most popular VPL used all over the world. Scratch was developed by the MIT in 2002, and since then a big community has been created around it, where you can find millions of projects to replicate with your students and countless tutorials in several languages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You do not need to have any coding experience to use Scratch, and you can use it in all the different subjects! For instance, using Scratch as a digital storytelling tool, students can create stories, illustrate a math problem or play an art contest to learn about cultural heritage, while learning coding and computational thinking, and most important, having fun.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Scratch is a free tool, very intuitive and motivating for your students. Have a look at Margo’s video to learn how to get started.

Scratch not only enhances computational thinking, but it also allows the introduction of gamification elements in the classroom to keep your students motivated while learning and having fun.

In this video, Ivana Vezjak introduces you to  Python’s basic syntax. Python is one of the most popular programming languages today, used in many fields like data science, AI, machine learning, web development, etc. While Python is a powerful programming language used by experienced programmers, it can be used even by those without any coding experience because of its simplicity and clear syntax.</p><p> 
With Python, students can create quizzes about historical events, solve math problems and make physics simulations, create games, build websites, conduct data analysis for scientific projects, and much more. Python has a rich and extensive standard library, a large community, and a great number of tutorials and projects available online, which can be used for teaching, learning, and practicing. By coding in Python, analysing programs, and fixing bugs, students develop creativity and learn how to be consistent, persistent, and patient. They learn analytical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down complex problems into smaller components. These competences will help them in how they approach problems in every other domain of their lives.

Therefore, it has an undeniable place in our lives and in our societies and it plays a key role in science development.

These activities are designed for students to develop their analytical and critical thinking skills: for example, in Marjana’s activity students develop a classification pipeline. These activities will also help students understand the varied applications of AI: in Artur’s activity they will learn about the link between AI and Art, and how AI can be used to enhance visual expression.
