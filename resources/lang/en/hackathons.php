After 24 hours of hacking, each team will pitch their ideas to a panel of experts who will choose the 10  finalist teams.  All teams will have the same amount of time, resources, and access to mentors and expertise in order to complete the challenge, but only 10 will get the chance to continue to the next round, develop their prototype, get expert coaching  and take part in the final hackathon in the autumn. Here the teams will battle it out to decide who wins cool IT gear and the chance of mentoring and coaching to further develop their prototype',
