      'Proponiamo laboratori di introduzione al pensiero computazionale nelle scuole dell’infanzia e primarie, a partire dai 5 anni. I percorsi prevedono l’utilizzo di diverse metodologie: coding unplugged, tinkering e robotica educativa, programmazione a blocchi con Scratch e Octostudio. Il nostro approccio parte dal lavoro teorico sviluppato dal gruppo di ricerca Lifelong Kindergarden del MIT di Boston.',
