                 'description' => 'FEPA has been the only EU-level organisation representing parents as a stakeholder group in education since its foundation in 1985. Through our 30+ member organisations we have a nearly full coverage of Europe as we have working contact with almost all EU-member states, while we have members from some non-EU countries (e.g. Serbia) as well.
                The main objectives of EPA, reaching out to 100 million European parents:
                - to promote and advocate for the active involvement of parents as primary educators at all stages of the education of their children,
                - to support parents\' associations and individual parents for stakeholder involvement in different European countries by offering opportunities for training, cooperation and exchanging information,
                - to support the highest possible quality of education for all children in Europe especially by active involvement in EU-level policy development and assessment
                - to disseminate relevant European information among its members.
                <br>
                EPA has started discussions with its members regarding digitalization and in particular the internet use back in 2014 when it issued its first position paper on the topic calling upon parents to engage in shaping the digital development rather than refusing to acknowledge its future importance. 
                Starting from this position paper EPA engaged in a first European project called “Parentnets” (http://www.parentnets.com) together with cooperation partners from Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Romania to establish an online game, video clips and an interactive handbook to make parents aware of six major concerns, cyberbullying, online gaming and phishing among others and offer advice on how to deal with these issues.
                In 2020 the annual theme of the organization was “Parenting in the Digital Age” adopted at a GA back in 2017 in the framework of a three-year working plan. It couldn’t have been more timely given the impact of the health crisis on the educational sector specifically the closure of school buildings worldwide and the shift to remote teaching and learning, in many cases online. During this period the importance of media and digital literacy became evident to everyone and surveys and studies have been conducted in many countries to find out how to best support learners (pupils and students) but also teachers and trainers as well as parents and families in the common endeavor to keep the learning and evaluation processes going. 
                In this situation EPA’s involvement in a specific project “Media Literacy for Parents” is of particular interest (www.medialiteracy4parents.eu). The project aimed at providing trainings for parents of school age children in this field as well as offering a WebApp and a Parents’ Guide. The partners in the project were from Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Poland and the material can be found on the website.
                <br>
                EPA is currently involved in two more projects in this field: HERMMES – Holistic Education and Media Maturity in Educational Settings – developing a framework curriculum for media education, training materials for educators and parents and school policy guidelines (https://hermmes.eu/) and e-Safety and e-Creativity, a network for teachers, parents and guardians (https://e-safety-network.eu/) that specifically deals with combatting cyberbullying and online-addiction so the CodeWeek falls very well in line with these initiatives, trying to enhance digital skills and fostering safe use as well as promoting non screen activities.',
