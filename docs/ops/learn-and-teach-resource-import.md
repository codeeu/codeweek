# Learn & Teach resource import

Internal runbook for publishing resources to **Learn & Teach**  
(`https://codeweek.eu/resources/learn-and-teach`).

Use this when the content team delivers a multi-sheet Excel workbook (metadata) plus PDFs/thumbnails (often on SharePoint).

---

## What gets published

| Kind | What it is | How `source` works |
|------|------------|--------------------|
| **Localised PDFs** | One resource per language (e.g. Albanian *Kodo një Mik*) | PDF uploaded to S3 (`RESOURCES_BUCKET`); card opens that PDF |
| **Third-party links** | External courses/sites (Intel Articulate, Science-on-Stage, etc.) | `source` is an `https://…` URL; card opens it in a **new tab** |

Frontend: `ResourceCard` uses `resource.source` with `target="_blank"`.

Language filter: each localised row is tagged with `filters_language` (e.g. Albanian). Users filter via the **Languages** control on the page — not via the site locale switcher (Shqip / English in the header).

---

## Tools in this repo

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `php artisan resources:import {file}` | CLI import: reads CSV/Excel next to `images/` + `links/`, uploads to S3, creates/updates `ResourceItem` |
| `/admin/resources-import` | Super-admin UI (verify → preview → import). Supports multi-sheet Learn & Teach workbooks + optional assets ZIP (after `learn-tech-import` is merged) |
| `scripts/prepare-learn-teach-upload.py` | Flattens multi-sheet Excel → `metadata.csv` + folder layout; copies from a local SharePoint sync folder |
| `scripts/download-learn-teach-from-sharepoint.py` | Downloads PDFs/thumbnails via **Microsoft Graph** using `az login` |
| `App\Services\LearnTeachWorkbookParser` | Parses the multi-sheet workbook; **reads Excel hyperlink targets** on Link cells |
| `App\Services\SharePointAssetFetcher` | Optional: fetch SharePoint URLs during import (only if the server can access the link) |

S3 config (server `.env`):

- `RESOURCES_BUCKET` / `RESOURCES_URL`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

No extra AWS form is needed in the admin UI — imports use that disk (`resources`).

---

## Spreadsheet format

Typical delivery: one Excel file with:

- **One sheet per resource group** (e.g. `Code a Friend`, `Binary Number Challenge`)
- Row 1 = headers  
- Row 2 = English group blurb (no language) — **skipped** by the parser  
- Row 3+ = one row per language  
- Final sheet: **`Third party resources`**

Important columns (display names → import keys):

| Spreadsheet | Import key |
|-------------|------------|
| Name of the Resource | `name_of_the_resource` |
| Link | `link` |
| Description | `description` |
| Filters - TYPE | `filters_type` |
| Filters - TARGET AUDIENCE | `filters_target_audience` |
| Filters - LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY | `filters_level_of_difficulty` |
| Filters - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE | `filters_programming_language` |
| Filters - SUBJECT | `filters_subject` |
| Filters - TOPICS | `filters_topics` |
| Filters - LANGUAGE / Language | `filters_language` |
| Image | `image` |

The import also sets `group_name` from the **sheet title** (used to find PDFs under `links/{group_name}/`).

### Link column gotchas

1. **PDF filename** (most localisation rows): e.g. `ALBANIAN_02 Code a Friend_LOCALISED.pdf`  
   → must exist under `links/{group}/` (or be downloadable).
2. **SharePoint URL** (sometimes): full `https://….sharepoint.com/…pdf`  
   → download locally first, or use Graph script / guest-accessible fetch.
3. **Excel hyperlink on title text** (Intel third-party): cell *displays* the course title but the real URL is the hyperlink (e.g. `https://share.articulate.com/…`).  
   **Always read the hyperlink target**, not only the visible value.  
   `LearnTeachWorkbookParser` and `prepare-learn-teach-upload.py` do this.

### Image column

Local filename (`Binary number challenge.png`) → file in `images/`.  
Or an `https://…` URL (kept / fetched when possible).

## Folder layout for CLI import

```
learn-teach-upload-YYYY/
├── metadata.csv          # flattened rows
├── images/               # thumbnails
└── links/
    ├── Binary Number Challenge/
    │   └── ALBANIAN_01 ….pdf
    ├── Code a Friend/
    │   └── …
    └── …
```

The Excel/CSV path and the `images` / `links` folders must sit in the **same directory**.

```bash
php artisan resources:import /path/to/learn-teach-upload-YYYY/metadata.csv --focus --batch-timestamp
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--focus` | Create missing filter options (types, levels, languages, …) |
| `--batch-timestamp` | Same Unix suffix for all S3 files in this run |
| `--stable-names` | No timestamp (overwrites same S3 key) |
| `--preserve-filenames` | Use local basenames as S3 keys |

---

## Recommended workflow

### 1. Get PDFs from SharePoint (authenticated)

SharePoint is not anonymously downloadable. Use Azure CLI against the JA Europe tenant, then Graph:

```bash
az login --tenant dc75c1d7-1a32-4e97-af90-1dc01911ea6c --allow-no-subscriptions

python3 scripts/download-learn-teach-from-sharepoint.py \
  --xlsx "docs/internal/New Resources Learn&Teach Metadata - 23 June 2026.xlsx" \
  --out docs/internal/learn-teach-upload-2026

# Optional: one language only
python3 scripts/download-learn-teach-from-sharepoint.py --languages Albanian
```

Then rebuild metadata (and optionally re-copy from a sync folder):

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare-learn-teach-upload.py \
  --xlsx "docs/internal/New Resources Learn&Teach Metadata - 23 June 2026.xlsx" \
  --out docs/internal/learn-teach-upload-2026 \
  --source-dir docs/internal/learn-teach-upload-2026
```

Working assets stay under **`docs/internal/`** (gitignored). Do **not** commit PDFs/ZIPs.

Zip for admin UI upload if needed:

```bash
cd docs/internal/learn-teach-upload-2026
zip -r learn-teach-assets.zip links images
```

### 2. Test on DEV first

Servers (Forge):

| Env | SSH | App dir |
|-----|-----|---------|
| **DEV** | `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa forge@35.156.58.10` | `cd dev.codeweek.eu` |
| **Live** | `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa forge@3.68.107.5` | `cd codeweek.eu` |

```bash
# From your laptop: upload package
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa metadata.csv learn-teach-assets.zip \
  forge@35.156.58.10:/home/forge/dev.codeweek.eu/storage/app/learn-teach-upload-2026/

# On DEV — unzip + import in the SAME session
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa forge@35.156.58.10
cd /home/forge/dev.codeweek.eu
cd storage/app/learn-teach-upload-2026 && unzip -o -q learn-teach-assets.zip
cd /home/forge/dev.codeweek.eu
php artisan resources:import "$(realpath storage/app/learn-teach-upload-2026/metadata.csv)" \
  --focus --batch-timestamp
```

**Note:** DEV often uses the same `RESOURCES_BUCKET` as production (`codeweek-resources`). PDFs land in that bucket; DB rows are only on the DEV database until you import on live.

### 3. QA on DEV

1. Open https://dev.codeweek.eu/resources/learn-and-teach  
2. Hard refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R`)  
3. **Languages** filter → Albanian (or another language) — expect localised titles  
4. Open **View lesson** → correct language PDF from S3  
5. Spot-check a third-party card → Articulate / external site in a new tab  

If the language filter shows **no cards** after selecting a language while you were on page 2+, you need the ResourceForm fix (filters must reset to page 1). That fix lives on branch `learn-tech-import`.

### 4. Publish on live

Same upload + unzip + `resources:import` on `codeweek.eu`, then QA on  
https://codeweek.eu/resources/learn-and-teach  

Prefer **one SSH session** for unzip + import so assets are present on the same host that runs Artisan.

### 5. Git / deploy flow for code changes

Feature work (importer, scripts, UI fixes):

1. Branch (e.g. `learn-tech-import`)  
2. PR → `dev`  
3. QA on DEV  
4. PR → `main` / `master`  

Do not push one-off PDF packages to git.

## Admin UI path (when deployed)

1. Sign in as **super admin**  
2. `/admin/resources-import`  
3. Upload multi-sheet `.xlsx` **or** `metadata.csv`  
4. Optionally upload assets ZIP (`links/` + `images/`)  
5. Enable **Focus** → **Verify** → edit Link/Image in preview if needed → **Import**  

Third-party hyperlinks are resolved by `LearnTeachWorkbookParser` when uploading the raw workbook.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Card link is a PDF **filename**, not S3 URL | `links/` missing or wrong path at import time | Re-upload assets; import with absolute path to CSV in same dir as `links/` |
| Intel courses open nothing / show title as URL | Excel hyperlink not read | Re-parse with hyperlink-aware parser; update `source` to Articulate URL |
| Language filter returns empty | UI stayed on page 2+ after selecting language | Deploy ResourceForm fix; or click Search / go to page 1 |
| SharePoint download fails (login HTML) | No auth / wrong tenant | `az login` to JA Europe tenant; use Graph download script |
| Filter values missing | Typo vs DB (`beginners`, `Ukranian`, …) | Import with `--focus` or normalise spreadsheet |
| English “Uploaded on …” date looks old | Description text from an earlier English upload | Localisation batch often has no English rows; update English description separately if needed |

Check recent rows:

```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="
\$n = \\App\\ResourceItem::where('updated_at', '>=', now()->subHour())->count();
echo \"updated last hour: \$n\n\";
"
```
