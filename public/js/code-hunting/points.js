Braun also contributed significantly to the development of radio and television technology, sharing the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Guglielmo Marconi. Karl Braun was also the first to foresee the use of a CRT as a display device."

This single drum replaced the multiple drums, typically around 10 or so, of contemporary calculators, and it enabled not only addition, but subtraction through nines complement math, essentially subtracting by adding. The nines' complement math breakthrough eliminated the significant mechanical complexity created when \"borrowing\" during subtraction. This drum was the key to miniaturizing the Curta."
